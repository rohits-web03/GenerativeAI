## Features ✨
- Enter a YouTube URL to get a summary.
- Fetches video transcripts automatically.
- Generates summaries using Ollama's Llama 3.1 model.
- Clean and easy-to-use interface.

## Requirements 📋
- Python 3.8+
- Ollama (with Llama 3.1 model installed)
- Libraries: `streamlit`, `youtube-transcript-api`, `requests`

## Future Improvements 🚧
This is a **basic prototype**. More features like support for longer videos, multi-language summaries, and export options will be added later.
